# How-to-get-an-internship-as-Bsc
Let's be honest, to achieve the aceptance for a internship is really hard, competitive, take time and you will get a lot of rejections and maybe ghosting but at the end if you had decide to pursue a career in research is worthing. So even If by the time I write this repository I didn't get any internship yet, I'm still trying and you too.
