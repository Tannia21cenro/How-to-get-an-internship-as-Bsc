# How-to-get-an-internship-as-Bsc
Let's be honest, to achieve the aceptance for a internship is really hard, competitive, take time and you will get a lot of rejections and maybe ghosting but at the end if you had decide to pursue a research career is worth it. So even If by the time I write this repository I didn't get any internship yet, I'm still trying and you too. I'm peruvian bachelor student, so all the internships here are for international students around the world. 

First, take in consideration that maybe you will need to guide to your professor to help you with a letter of recommendation, so I will give you an example of what kind of draft you have to do to show them to sing: https://medicine.cuny.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Sample-Letters-of-Recommendation.pdf
